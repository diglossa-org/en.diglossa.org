- all words in the text (usually a sentence, or a few sentences) are checked in the special hand-made dictionary of "terms." Here in "terms" I call words that do not require further analysis. For example, all forms of pronouns, articles, all unchangeable entries in the dictionary, irregular verb forms, etc. Since the Greeks recorded speech, and not "informative text," they recorded everything they heard. For example, words in a phrase εἴ περ γάρ ἐστιν ἡ ψυχὴ ἐν has only one non-term word the - ψυχὴ, and all others are particles, prepositions, articles, and the finite form of verb "is", - so, "terms".
- for the remaining mutable words, the possible dictionary entries are computed from their affixes. For this, the form is passed through a cascade of filter modules. The number of filters will be increased in the next versions. Thus, only the forms actually presenting in the dictionary are found.
- as a last step - typical connections are established between the words of the sentence. Related words are underlined. Morpheus does not analyze the syntactic structure of the sentence completely. So far, only related articles, pronouns, and names have been singled out and emphasized. So bare wordform and wordform in a sentence have the different morphologies, for the convenience of reading.
